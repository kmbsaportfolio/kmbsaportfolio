                    Shooting game
                </h1>
                <img src="Project1.jpg" alt="Project 1">
                <p class="description">I made this futuristic themed point shooting game out of web programming languages.
                    The inspiration came from duck hunt, a childhood game for many that were able to use the NES console.
                    I learned from a video online how to implement a collision detection system based on colors, animate sprites,
                    and created a bunch of enemies to click and shoot for points. The game's rules are quite simple, you click the
                    enemies for them to be destroyed. Different enemy types have different scores. You may only leak up to 3 
                    enemies or the game is over.
                    <br><br>
                    All of the sprites and the background were downloaded for free from various websites. Upon doing the math, I
                    was able to determine the sprite's frames and animations resolution then used delta time to allow the sprite's
                    animations be observable. At the same time, delta time is used as a way to spawn each of the enemies upon reaching
                    a certain amount of time. As I play tested the game, I saw the armada of enemies swarming my screen which is exactly
                    how I wanted the game to do.
                    <br><br>
                    I created a variety of enemies, all with different movement patterns to create a bit of complexity. It felt
                    really stale to play when every single one of the enemies were only running in a straight lines. Enemies die
                    upon one click with the exception of the big spaceship. A combination of fast drones and fast spaceships made
                    the game need focus to prevent leaking. Other enemies were made to be slower to have a better pacing and more balanced
                    gamplay for the players.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately I have no idea how to solve the black background of the sprites. Supposedly the png files are going
                    to show the sprites with transparent background. I also should have used a rectangle collision system instead so that
                    there can be collateral targets upon click. Lastly, I was supposed to make a crosshair, but upon testing it does not seem
                    to follow the mouse properly so I went ahead to cancel the idea.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I learnt a lot upon constructing this simple arcade game.

                    Courier App
                </h1>
                <img src="Project2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
                <p class="description">For a school project, my team and I were assigned to create a Dash Dispatch Courier App.
                    It is written in dart language as the class was all about android programming. I came up with the idea to name 
                    the application as PickApp, which is a play on words on pick up and app. The team agreed, making it the official
                    name of the application. <br><br>
                    When creating the UI of the app, we browsed various courier applications and established the important element that
                    we need and implemented it in our application. We created a system that lets the user know his/her active deliveries,
                    a history of their deliveries, an inbox to allow the riders to communicate when they arrive with the package, and a draft
                    section which allow users to plan ahead a delivery. A login page to authorize users of their accounts, along with a registration
                    so that people can enter their informations to be used for the application's purpose. Of course the core component of the application,
                    the function to have an item be delivered by you or to you. The application will find a rider, notify them of the job, and if they accept
                    the deliveree will be able to see the deliverer's location and theirs on a map.
